# Interactive Shader Format

ISF stands for "Interactive Shader Format", and is a file format that describes a GLSL fragment shader, as well as how to execute and interact with it. The goal of this file format is to provide a simple and minimal interface for image filters and generative video sources that allows them to be interacted with and reused in a generic and modular fashion.

ISF was originally created by [VIDVOX](https://vidvox.net) in 2013 and is now on version 2.0 of its release.

## ISF Documentation

Information related to using ISF compositions and FX in various host software can be found here: [ISF Documentation](https://github.com/Vidvox/isf-docs/).

This includes:
- The ISF Quick Start, a guide to quickly get started with writing GLSL shaders in the ISF specification. A good starting point for people who already know how to code and are just looking to understand the core concepts of ISF.
- The ISF Reference Pages, an overview of the available built-in variables, functions and other conventions used by ISF as a quick reference for shader developers.
- The ISF Primer, a set of in depth lessons with walkthroughs for writing your first GLSL shaders and discussion of advanced usages of the ISF specification.

## ISF Shader Library

The standard set of ISF compositions and FX that are included with VDMX can be found here: [ISF Files](https://github.com/Vidvox/ISF-Files)

Simple test ISF files that demonstrate ISF's basic features: [ISF Test/Tutorial filters](http://vidvox.net/rays_oddsnends/ISF%20tests+tutorials.zip)
(these are test filters, and we don't expect them to have signifcant creative use)

A community website where ISF files can be created, viewed and shared online can be found here: [interactiveshaderformat.com](https://www.interactiveshaderformat.com)

## ISF Specification

The [ISF Specification Page](https://github.com/mrRay/ISF_Spec/) contains detailed information about ISF application developers, along with links to source code repositories and other useful resources to get started with.
